# 🚨 AMPLIFY REDIRECT DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed Conflicting Files:**
   - ❌ Deleted `public/redirects.json` (was causing conflicts)
   - ✅ Kept clean `public/_redirects` file

2. **Enhanced Build Process:**
   - Added explicit redirect file copying verification
   - Build now shows confirmation that _redirects is copied to dist/

3. **Clean Configuration:**
   - Single redirect rule: `/*    /index.html   200`
   - Proper Netlify/Amplify format

## 🔍 Check These in Amplify Console:

### Build Output Should Show:
```
> npm run build
> cp public/_redirects dist/_redirects  
> echo "Redirects file copied to dist directory"
> ls -la dist/_redirects
```

### Latest Commit to Look For:
- **Commit:** `e9984bb` - "CRITICAL: Clean redirects and force Amplify rebuild"
- **Date:** September 25, 2025

### Test After Build Completes:
1. ✅ Visit `/admin` - should load without 404
2. ✅ Check for "v2.0.0 - Full Admin System" in header
3. ✅ Login should work with Cognito
4. ✅ Image upload should work without CORS errors

## 🚨 If STILL Not Working:

### Check Build Logs:
- Look for "Redirects file copied to dist directory" message
- Verify `ls -la dist/_redirects` shows the file exists

### Manual Override:
Go to Amplify Console → **Rewrites and redirects** → Add:
```
Source: /*
Target: /index.html  
Type: 200 (Rewrite)
```

## 📋 Environment Variables Reminder:
Make sure these are set in Amplify:
```
VITE_AUTH_ENDPOINT = https://maqo72gd3h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/get-api-key
VITE_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT = https://maqo72gd3h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/upload-url
VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID = us-east-1_fzogF46tc
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID = 3d3cij4c87drjkuko3np8lmn1d
